        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

    </div>

    <h2>§ 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS AND CONTACT INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>1. These Terms and Conditions (hereinafter: "Terms") define the rules for using the online platform available at https://eulaliafotografia.com, as well as the rules for providing electronic services and delivering digital content.</p>
    
    <p>2. The Service Provider is Cirrenz Eulalia Twarog, with its registered office at Emil Schmid Str. 13, 75378 Bad Liebenzell, Germany (Deutschland).</p>
    
    <div class="contact-details">

        <p>Phone: +49 176 36385781</p>
        <p>E-mail: info@eulaliafotografia.com</p>
    </div>

    <p>3. The sale of Courses on the Platform is conducted via the Merchant of Record (MoR) model. The entity responsible for the payment process, tax calculation, and issuing sales documents (invoices/receipts) is Lemon Squeezy LLC, based in the USA (hereinafter: "Payment Operator").</p>

    <h2>§ 2. DEFINITIONS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Course</strong> – digital content in the form of online educational materials.</li>
        <li><strong>User</strong> – any entity entering into an agreement with the Service Provider (Consumer or Entrepreneur).</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer</strong> – a natural person making a purchase for purposes not directly related to their business or professional activity (§ 13 BGB).</li>
        <li><strong>Entrepreneur (B2B)</strong> – a natural person, legal person, or organizational unit making a purchase within the scope of their business or professional activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform</strong> – the IT system at https://eulaliafotografia.com.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>§ 3. CONCLUSION OF AGREEMENT AND ACCESS</h2>
    <p>1. The conclusion of the agreement for the delivery of digital content occurs at the moment of successful payment by the User through the Payment Operator.</p>
    <p>2. The User gains access to the Course immediately after the transaction is confirmed (usually in real-time, no later than within 24 hours).</p>
    <p>3. During the purchase process, the User may consent to the delivery of digital content before the expiry of the withdrawal period, which results in the loss of the right to withdraw from the agreement pursuant to § 7 of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>§ 4. USAGE RULES AND ACCESS GUARANTEE</h2>
    <p>1. Access to the Course is limited to the duration of the Platform's operation. The Service Provider makes every effort to ensure that the Platform is available continuously.</p>
    <p>2. Access Permanence Guarantee: In the event that the Service Provider decides to terminate the Platform's operation or permanently remove the Course from the offer, the Service Provider undertakes to inform the User at least 1 month in advance.</p>
    <p>3. In the situation referred to in paragraph 2, the Service Provider will provide the User with Course materials in a form that allows them to be saved on a durable medium (e.g., PDF files, graphic materials, and video files or download links), so that the User can use the purchased content without the Platform's mediation.</p>
    <p>4. Courses are optimized for web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard and a stable internet connection with a minimum speed of 5 Mbps.</p>

    <h2>§ 5. LICENSE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
    <p>1. Upon gaining access to the Course, the Service Provider grants the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and territorially unlimited license to use the content solely for personal use or within their own company (in the case of Entrepreneurs).</p>
    <p>2. Prohibitions: The User is prohibited from copying, public performance, resale, sublicensing, and sharing Account access data with third parties.</p>
    <p>3. Security: The Service Provider uses systemic and technical security measures to monitor abuse and protect copyrights (including IP monitoring, watermarks).</p>
    <p>4. In the event of a breach of license terms, the Service Provider has the right to permanently block access to the Account without a refund of the fee paid, regardless of the right to seek damages under general legal principles.</p>

    <h2>§ 6. PAYMENTS AND TAXES</h2>
    <p>1. Course prices are gross prices and include VAT at the rate appropriate for the User's country of residence (pursuant to the VAT OSS/MOSS system operated by Lemon Squeezy).</p>
    <p>2. The sales document is issued by the Payment Operator and sent electronically.</p>

    <h2>§ 7. RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL</h2>
    <p>1. The Consumer has the right to withdraw from the agreement within 14 days without giving any reason, provided that the delivery of digital content has not commenced.</p>
    <p>2. Pursuant to Art. 16(m) of Directive 2011/83/EU and German § 356 para. 5 BGB, the right of withdrawal expires if the delivery of digital content has begun with the Consumer's express consent and after their acknowledgment that they thereby lose their right of withdrawal.</p>
    <p>3. Obtaining immediate access to the Course content on the Platform after purchase is equivalent to the commencement of service delivery.</p>

    <h2>§ 8. COMPLAINTS</h2>
    <p>1. The User has the right to submit a complaint in the event of technical defects in the materials or inconsistency of the content with the description.</p>
    <p>2. Complaints should be submitted via email to the address provided in § 1.</p>
    <p>3. The Service Provider will consider the complaint within 14 days.</p>

    <h2>§ 9. PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION</h2>
    <p>1. The Data Controller is the Service Provider.</p>
    <p>2. Data is processed for the purpose of agreement execution, technical support, and (with separate consent) for marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>3. Detailed information on data processing, including its transfer to entities such as Lemon Squeezy or hosting providers, can be found in the Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>§ 10. FINAL PROVISIONS</h2>
    <p>1. Governing Law: Agreements are concluded based on German law. In the case of Consumers, this choice does not deprive them of the protection granted by the mandatory provisions of the law of the country of their habitual residence.</p>
    <p>2. Dispute Resolution: The Consumer has the right to use the EU's Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform available at: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.</p>
    <p>3. Language Versions: The Terms have been prepared in several language versions (DE, PL, EN, IT, ES, FR). In relations with Consumers, the language version in which the agreement was concluded is binding. In B2B relations, the German version takes precedence.</p>
    <p>4. Severability Clause: If any provision of the Terms is found to be invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain in force.</p>
