Photographer's Glossary
Flat lay
A photo taken from above.
Depth of field
What's sharp and what's blurred in a photo. On a smartphone, you can blur the background using portrait mode, among other features.
Bokeh
A soft, blurred background with delicate points of light.
White balance
A setting that ensures your photo isn't too yellow or too blue.
Rule of thirds
Dividing the image into three equal parts both horizontally and vertically.
It's best to position the most important elements along the lines or at their intersections.
Soft light
Diffused light without harsh shadows — the most natural and flattering for food photography.
Hard light
Strong light that creates distinct, sharp shadows — rarely used in food photography because it distorts the dish.
RAW
Captures more detail than a regular photo.
This allows you to easily adjust brightness and colors later without losing quality.
