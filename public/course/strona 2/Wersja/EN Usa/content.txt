I help restaurants create photos that are worthy of their dishes.

I have photographed for Michelin-starred restaurants in Germany, Austria, Great Britain, Poland, and the United States.
My photo was featured on the cover of JRE Guide Deutschland.

I teach how to take elegant, clean, and intentional photos of dishes using a smartphone.
