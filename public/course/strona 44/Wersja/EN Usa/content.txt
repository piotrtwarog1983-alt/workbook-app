Cropping and straightening

Find the CROP icon and decide whether you want to zoom in on the dish 
or need to straighten the photo.
If you have doubts, refer to the composition lesson.
Want more zoom? Apply it by cropping more of the background around. 
Try not to crop more than 30 percent of the photo.
