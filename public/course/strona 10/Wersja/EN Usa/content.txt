Let's start with phone settings. If your smartphone allows it, turn on:

**Portrait Mode**
What does it do?
The phone will blur the background, making the dish the main focus.

**RAW Mode**
What does it do?
The photo will be better quality and easier to correct later without losing quality during editing.

**What to turn off?**

**Flash**
Flash shines directly on the dish from the front. This is the worst light — the dish looks flat and less appetizing.

Turn off **eye comfort mode**, blue light filter (e.g., Night Shift) on your phone. These modes warm up the screen and distort colors.
